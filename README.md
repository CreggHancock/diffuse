### Hosting on your own server

Diffuse is a static web application, which means it's just HTML, CSS and Javascript. No REST API, database, or anything backend-related involved. The app uses a hash, aka. fragment, based routing system, so you don't need any special server rules for routing. You can download a pre-build web-only version of Diffuse on the [releases](https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse/releases) page. Diffuse uses service workers, so you may need HTTPS for it to work smoothly in certain browsers. I should also note that some source services use OAuth, so you'll need to use your own application credentials (eg. google drive client id + secret).

In short:
- Diffuse is a static, serverless, web application
- Routing is done using hashes/fragments (eg. `diffuse.sh/#/sources`)
- Download a web build on the [releases](https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse/releases) page
- Uses service workers (use HTTPS if possible)
- May need own OAuth application credentials for some source services
